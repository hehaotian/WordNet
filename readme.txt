My results here are quite not good, with nine entries different from the gold standard and nine the same. The correct sense I could get here is only nine out of the total eighteen, which is only the half.

Among the first six entries which Professor Levow asked us to get right, I only get three of them. The others are,

head 
head.n.11	the length or height based on the size of a human or animal head

hand
hand.n.09	a unit of length equal to 4 inches; used in measuring horses

seat
seat.n.05	a center of authority (as a city from which authority is exercised)


If I exclude head and hand, as Professor Levow said “It's okay if these (head/hand) don't match the gold standard.”, I got the accuracy only as low as 56.25% (9/16).
